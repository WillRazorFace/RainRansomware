# RainRansomware

Rain is Python-made Ransomware that uses 32-byte AES encryption

## Operation

- Creates Windows registrys where the random key generated for file encryption and a rule for calling the main file every time the system boots are saved.

- Encrypt the three commonly used directories (Desktop, Documents, and Downloads)

- It proceeds to encrypt the entire disk and possible other storage devices attached to the computer.

## Future features

Executable files, a graphical interface and , perhaps, in a while, an online payment verification system will be added.
